<details><summary><strong>How to Add Your Own Custom Pupils and Irises</strong></summary>

<br>

### 1. Install Unity Repo Patcher
Follow the [Installation Guide for Unity Repo Patcher](https://github.com/Kesomannen/unity-repo-project-patcher).  
This tool extracts the game's assets and creates a Unity project.

---

### 2. Extract the Pupil Mesh

1. Open the Unity project generated by the patcher.
2. Add the `PlayerAvatar` to the scene.
3. Click on one of the pupil objects (`mesh_pupil_r` or `mesh_pupil_l`).

#### Export the Mesh as FBX:
a. If you don’t have the **FBX Exporter** package:
- Open **Window → Package Manager**
- In the top left, switch to **Unity Registry**
- In the search bar (top right), type `FBX Exporter` and install it

b. Right-click the pupil mesh (e.g., `mesh_pupil_r`) → **Export to FBX**

c. In the export window:
- **Export Path**: Choose any folder  
- **Export Format**: `Binary`  
- **Include**: `Model(s) Only`  
- Leave the rest as default

---

### 3. Modify in Blender

1. Import the exported FBX file into **Blender**.
2. **Duplicate** the mesh to keep the original for reference.
3. Modify it however you want (resize pupil, reshape iris, etc.).
4. When done, **delete the original** (if desired) and export the edited mesh.

#### Export Settings:
a. In Unity, navigate to your desired folder for pupils/irises → **Right-click → Show in Explorer** → Copy the path  
b. In Blender:  
**File → Export → FBX**  
- Paste the Unity folder path  
- Under "Object Types": select only `Mesh`  
- Export

---

### 4. Create Prefabs in Unity

1. In Unity, create a new GameObject and follow this naming convention:
   - Examples: `cat_pupil_right`, `diamond_iris_left`

2. Add the following components:
   - `Mesh Filter` (assign the mesh from the FBX)
   - `Mesh Renderer` (apply the `Player Avatar - Pupil` material)

3. Drag the GameObject into your folder to save it as a **Prefab**.

---

### 5. Build the AssetBundle

You’ll need an AssetBundle builder. Here are two options:

#### a. [AssetBundle Browser](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AssetBundles-Browser)
> An older but still functional tool for building AssetBundles.

#### b. [CR AssetBundle Builder](https://github.com/XuuXiaolan/CR-AssetBundle-Builder)
> A modern alternative by [Xu](https://github.com/XuuXiaolan) with more features, especially for multi-bundle projects.

1. Add the tool to your Unity project as shown in the Unity Repo Patcher guide.
2. Assign the same AssetBundle name to all your pupil and iris prefabs.
3. Build the AssetBundle.

---

### 6. Package for Thunderstore

Follow the [Thunderstore package format documentation](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/create/docs/).

#### Useful Tools:
- 📄 [Markdown Preview](https://thunderstore.io/tools/markdown-preview/): Build and preview your README.
- ✅ [Manifest Validator](https://thunderstore.io/tools/manifest-v1-validator/): Validate your manifest file.

> **Reminder:** Your mod should list this base mod as a dependency.
